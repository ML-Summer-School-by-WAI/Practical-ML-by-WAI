## Project Overview

This project aims to build and evaluate a deep learning model capable of segmenting cats and dogs from images. Semantic segmentation allows us to assign each pixel in an image to a specific class (cat, dog, or background), enabling precise identification and separation. It uses **U-Net architecture with a MobileNet model** through transfer learning approaches.

## Project Workflow

- **Preparation:**  
  Images of cats and dogs were **annotated using LabelMe**.  
  The annotations were then **converted into Pascal VOC format** and the segmentation masks were **encoded** for efficient training.

- **Model Architecture:**  
  Implemented **U-Net semantic segmentation architectures** with a **MobileNet** for transfer learning.

- **Deployment:**  
  The trained model was deployed using a **FastAPI backend** for making predictions.  
  To ensure portability and scalability, the entire one was **containerized with Docker**, to be able to run across different environments.

## Dataset

The project uses a custom annotated dataset containing cats and dogs. Please refer to the [data/](dataset/cat_and_dog_dataset) folder for instructions on downloading and structuring the dataset.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ML-Summer-School-by-WAI/Practical-ML-by-WAI.git

   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pipenv install
   pipenv shell
   ```

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook: (OPTIONAL)**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Local Fast API Usage
