## Summary of Major Approaches

| Approach                 | Primary Goal                                        | Key Characteristic                                         | When It's Used                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Waterfall**            | Predictability and thorough planning                | Linear, sequential phases. Inflexible.                     | Projects with fixed, unchanging requirements.      |
| **Agile (general)**      | Adaptability and customer satisfaction              | Iterative cycles (sprints), collaboration, flexibility.      | Most modern software projects.                     |
| **TDD** (a technique)    | High code quality and a safety net of tests         | Write tests *before* code (Red-Green-Refactor).          | At the code level, often within an Agile process.  |
| **BDD** (a technique)    | Align development with user behavior                | Tests written in human-readable language (Given/When/Then). | At the feature level, to improve team communication. |
| **ATDD** (a technique)   | Ensure software meets customer acceptance criteria  | Collaborative creation of acceptance tests before coding.  | At the feature level, to clarify requirements.     |
| **DDD** (a design approach) | Master complexity by modeling the core business domain | Ubiquitous Language, Bounded Contexts, rich domain model.    | Complex systems where business rules are critical. |
